# SprintHub Images

This service handles the generation of image serving URLs for [SprintHub's website](https://sprinthub.com.ng) using the Google App Engine images service. This service was necessary because the images API is available on only
App Engine.

## Developing SprintHub Images

Clone this repo to your local workstation and run `dep ensure` to pull the dependencies. Dependencies are
managed using `dep`.

Before deploying this app to App Engine, _delete the vendor directory_. This is necessary to appease the
`gcloud app deploy` command. A sample error message you may encounter deploying without deleting the _vendor_ directory is
> ERROR: (gcloud.app.deploy) Error Response: [9] Deployment contains files that cannot be compiled: Compile failed:
2018/07/06 11:25:28 go-app-builder: Failed parsing input: package "github.com/SprintHubNigeria/sprinthub-images/vendor/google.golang.org/appengine/image" cannot import internal package "google.golang.org/appengine/internal"

This is a [known issue](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-appengine-go/Xooyiq3kFTI) with the `gcloud` tool.
